# Installation
- Install BepInEx
- Extract ``\BepInEx\plugins\WesV2.dll`` into the ``\BepInEx\plugins\`` folder inside your game

# UltrakULL support
Since version 1.2.0 the mod supports overriding V2's voicelines and subtitles with
[UltrakULL](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/UltrakULL/UltrakULL/)

To do so simply install both this mod and UltrakULL and it should work just fine if
translators added suport for this mod

Note that it isn't a hard dependency, this mod works even WITHOUT having UltrakULL installed

## For translators
To add translations for V2's subtitles you can use [this website](https://kyryh.github.io/update-lang-json.html)
to automatically add the subtitles to the json file

You can also replace the audio clips by putting them in the ``\BepInEx\config\ultrakull\audio\<lang>\v2_1\`` and
``\BepInEx\config\ultrakull\audio\<lang>\v2_2\`` folders

The audio clip filenames and subtitles are as follows:

- ``v2_1``
  - ``jumpscare``
	- ``subtitles_v2_jumpscare_1``: Oh shit watch out
	- ``subtitles_v2_jumpscare_2``: I'm comin' through
  - ``windowbreak``
	- ``subtitles_v2_windowsbreak``: Oh fuck here I come
